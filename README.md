Hi, this is a pretty empty starter template for a Godot 4 project (mostly gamejam games) that includes a main menu with a Play and Exit button.

Might add a Godot 3 template as well as an options menu stub to the template.

If I feel real fancy I might make the main menu work as a pause menu instead of dropping game progress.

Contributions welcome of course :>
